# kneeD

(Knee dynamics because I feel the knee-d for speed... get it...)

We investigate how treadmill walking speed influences peak net torque at the knee during the swing phase of gait. Using high-speed (120 fps) video and MediaPipe Pose, we track 2D joint coordinates to compute shank angle, angular acceleration, and joint torques. A biomechanical model incorporating gravitational and inertial forces is applied to quantify knee torque dynamics across five walking speeds (0.50â€“1.50 m/s).

This repository includes full experimental protocol, calibration methods, Python analysis scripts, and uncertainty propagation.
